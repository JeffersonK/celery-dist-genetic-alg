Simple distributed GA example using Celery

ga_defs.py -> definitions for the ga, the evaluation function is in the domain class, notice it sleeps for some time as a placeholder for significant computation

ga.py -> really simplistic genetic algorithm, the eval_concurrent flag determines whether genomes are evaluated sequentially or concurrently by celery

celeryconfig.py -> default config for celery, uses ampq backend and imports the task fromg a_defs.py
